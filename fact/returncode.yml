0:      EX_OK
        Successful termination
1:      Catchall for general errors
2:      Misuse of shell bultins
64:     EX_USAGE -
        The command was used incorrectly, e.g., with the
		wrong number of arguments, a bad flag, a bad syntax
		in a parameter, or whatever.
65:     EX_DATAERR -
        The input data was incorrect in some way.  This
		should only be used for user's data and not system
		files.
66:     EX_NOINPUT
        An input file (not a system file) did not exist or
		was not readable.  This could also include errors
		like ``No message'' to a mailer (if it cared to
		catch it).
67:     EX_NOUSER
        The user specified did not exist.  This might be
		used for mail addresses or remote logins.
68:     EX_NOHOST
        The host specified did not exist.  This is used in
		mail addresses or network requests.
69:     EX_UNAVALABLE
        A service is unavailable.  This can occur if a sup足
		port program or file does not exist.  This can also
		be used as a catchall message when something you
		wanted to do doesn't work, but you don't know why.
70:     EX_SOFTWARE
        An internal software error has been detected.  This
		should be limited to non-operating system related
		errors as possible.
71:     EX_OSERR
        An operating system error has been detected.  This
		is intended to be used for such things as ``cannot
		fork'', ``cannot create pipe'', or the like.  It
		includes things like getuid returning a user that
		does not exist in the passwd file.
72:     EX_OSFILE
        Some system file (e.g., /etc/passwd, /var/run/utmp,
		etc.) does not exist, cannot be opened, or has some
		sort of error (e.g., syntax error).
73:     EX_CANTCREAT
        A (user specified) output file cannot be created.
74:     EX_IOERR
        An error occurred while doing I/O on some file.
75:     EX_TEMPFAIL
        Temporary failure, indicating something that is not
		really an error.  In sendmail, this means that a
		mailer (e.g.) could not create a connection, and
		the request should be reattempted later.
76:     EX_PROTOCOL
        The remote system returned something that was ``not
		possible'' during a protocol exchange.
77:     EX_NOPERM
        You did not have sufficient permission to perform
		the operation.  This is not intended for file sys足
		tem problems, which should use EX_NOINPUT or
		EX_CANTCREAT, but rather for higher level permis足
		sions.

78:     EX_CONFIG
        Something was found in an unconfigured or miscon足
		figured state.
126:    Command invoked cannot execute
127:    Command not found
128:    Invalide argument to exit
128+n:  Fatal error signal "n"
130:    Script termintated by Control-C
255:    Exit status out of range
